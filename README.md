# CLUEper

Project 
CLUEper – A Digital Notecard Companion for the Board Game Clue
Project Description
CLUEper is an iOS mobile application idea I have had since I was a kid. Whenever I’d play the board game CLUE with my family, we’d always run out of the paper notecards. The idea behind this app is to replace the physical notecards with an electronic one, allowing players to digitally track suspects, weapons, and rooms across rounds of gameplay. 
The app is intended to be lightweight, intuitive, and usable during live board game sessions without disrupting play. CLUEper is planned for release on the Apple iOS App Store, hopefully before I graduate near the end of this semester.

Goals
Replace the physical Clue notecard with a digital notecard.


Track each round of physical gameplay and use this information to update the notecard.


Ensure the UI is simple enough to use while playing a physical game.


Prepare the app for eventual iOS App Store release

The project repository has been created and initialized. Initial documentation outlining the project goals, features, and technology stack has been added. Early SwiftUI prototype code demonstrates how Clue cards will be displayed and tracked digitally. Further UI development and game logic implementation are planned for future milestones.
